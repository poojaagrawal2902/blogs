Property tax.
What is a Property Tax?
Every property is an asset which is taxable and the amount which is paid by the owner of the property to the government annually is known as the property tax. The tax can be paid to the state government or the Municipal Corporation, depending on the government policies. The word “property” in this context refers to all tangible real estate under the ownership of an individual which includes houses, commercial spaces and rented spaces to a third party. 
The concept of property tax is been found around for centuries and is accepted across the globe, with proper records of farmers and workers paying tax on their properties even in the middle ages.


How to calculate property tax in India?
The given below is the formula used by the Municipal Corporation of India to calculate the property tax of an individual. 

Property tax = base value × built-up area × Age factor × type of building × category of use × floor factor.


Different civic corporations use different methods to calculate tax, but the general overview of such calculations remains the same.
Property tax in India depends on the location of the property, with taxes varying from state to state.
The first assessment is carried by finding the occupancy status whether it is self-occupied or rented out, type of property (residential or commercial), amenities provided (car parking, rainwater harvesting, store, etc.), year of construction (single floored or kutcha structure etc), and the carpet area of the property.
After getting the necessary details the civic agencies use the formula to calculate the tax.
The property tax can also be calculated online. Just visit the municipal corporation website and have a search for Property Tax Calculator.




How to find the real home value?
Start with online valuation tools
The information provided by you will be used along with the information gleaned from public records to get the estimated value of the property. It is a simple and convenient way to get a crystal clear idea of what your home might be worth.

	      -      Realtors use their own techniques for determining the value and it can be helpful  
                         to get a second opinion. The process used by realtors is known as Comparative   
                         Market Analysis (CMA).
                  -      Working on with CMA, realtors usually look for the recently sold homes that are 
                         Similar in size, location, no of bedrooms, location and in design.
                  -      Broker Price Opinion (BPO) is another tool to determine your home value. BPOs                  
                         are often use more than CMA for short sale or foreclosure situation rather than a  
                         regular home sales. BPOs costs money.

Impact of GST on the Real Estate sector.
Indian economy is established by many industries working to make the economy strong and real estate industry is one of it. In present real estate industry contributes 6-8% of GDP and it is assumed that it will grow up to 13% by 2030. 
 
At the recent GST council meeting held on 24th of February 2019, new GST rates have been introduced for residential real estate that will be applicable from 1st of April 2019. During the pre-GST era of taxation, multiple taxes were applicable such as VAT, stamp duty, registration charges and services charges that varied among different states with different charges. GST has played a significant role in simplifying the rates of taxation in the real estate sector that ranges from 5% - 18% depending upon some key factor.

 
After the GST implementation on real estate in 2017, the industry was in assuming a dropping posture. However, in early 2018, there was an increase in demand and supply for real estate.
The growth was increased in affordable mid-income housing. The rates for the sales property witnessed an increase while in larger cities such as Delhi has a 2% decline in property sales, not because of GST but of oversupply of the housing sector. As on a note 2019 promises to be a better year for Indian Real Estate as the demand for both commercial and residential properties is expected to get a boost.
