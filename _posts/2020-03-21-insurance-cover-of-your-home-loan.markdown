This goes especially for the salaried population who have their job as the main source of income.

The amount of home loan availed of to buy a house usually consists of a huge percentage of monthly income. In case of any unforeseen circumstances something happens to the primary income earner, it becomes almost impossible for the rest of the family to manage the household expenses let alone service the repayment of the home loan under such circumstances. Most of the time there aren’t enough savings to see the home loan repaid through its entire tenure. To avoid such situations, it is highly advisable to get an insurance cover for the home loan in case you are planning to buy a house.

The tenure of the insurance policy dedicated to the [home loan](https://blog.HomeCapital.in/5-easy-ways-to-manage-your-home-loan/) should be equal to the tenure of the home loan repayment. The lender will often ask you to buy a single premium term plan policy which is specially designed to go with home loans. The amount will be added to the home loan and will be recovered in the form of bigger EMI amounts. Rather you should choose an annual premium policy where you will pay a particular amount once a year which can be canceled anytime if you wish to. This is due to the fact that borrowers can choose to prepay the home loan to become free from any more cash outflow.

It is also possible to choose a term plan where the insurance amount gets reduced with the outstanding loan amount. In case you find such a good deal, then go ahead with it. This will make the insurance policy cheaper and affordable.
