The [Vaishnavi Group](https://homecapital.in/offering/developer/vaishnavi-group) is excited to design signature homes that are compatible with urban Indian's lifestyle needs. The Vaishnavi Group's projects are designed using the best of class building technologies and the analysis of ideas. Their commitment to providing world-class customer service is expressed in their cutting edge project management approaches and customer experience. The developers are now working with the same inspiration on a new project called [Vaishnavi Serene](https://homecapital.in/project/70/vaishnavi-serene), and are providing new ideas. Spread over a sprawling 33 guntas of 10 acres, Vaishnavi Serene in Bengaluru is a home like no other. This architecture is environmentally friendly and has special purifying properties for trees & shrubs. The property promotes a trend towards a healthy lifestyle and encourages group involvement. Vaishnavi Serene, a stylish luxury residential home, will provide a resort-like atmosphere that enriches your everyday life. Broad open fields, plenty of greenery, healthy children's play areas-this is indeed a rare urban residential land.

Yelahanka is one of the few areas of Bengaluru offering the town's old-world leafy charm. Vaishnavi Serene is located next to CRPF's evergreen campus. With more open fields, the surrounding areas enhance that natural abundance.
