The first thing that comes to our mind, while we plan to buy a home for us is the location. And it is apparent why location is our priority, no one wants to live in the most luxurious house somewhere in the middle of the desert. Our desire to buy a magnificent property is always accompanied by the enticing facilities that the location of the property has to bring.
So, which location should we choose in order to satisfy all our needs and desires?
The answer is Navi Mumbai!
Established in 1972, Navi Mumbai is one of the finest and largest well-planned townships in the country. This city is a classic example of the trend of urbanization in India and has grown tremendously over the last five years. The area experienced dramatic development and developed into a modern location, full of shops, hotels, multiplex theaters, and a number of other entertainment venues. Located about 29 km north-east of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai is an attractive town with many beautiful locations to visit, such as Vashi, Belapur, and Nerul. It is a great holiday destination for visitors as the city offers its guests a range of interesting views such as Rain Tree Marg, Kharghar, Central Park, etc. This twin town of Mumbai, located between Thane Creek, the Sahyadri Mountains, and the sea coast, was built to decongest Mumbai. The town of Navi Mumbai also offers its guests a range of fine restaurants and hotels to enjoy their stay in Navi Mumbai. There are also several premium restaurants and luxury hotels in Navi Mumbai for lodging, such as Four Points by Sheraton, The Forest, Fortune Choose Exotica, etc. There are several shopping malls, including Seawoods Grand Central Mall in Seawoods, Kharghar's Little World Mall, New Panvel's Orion Mall, Center One Mall, Vashi's Inorbit Mall, and Raghuleela Mall.
Now that we accept that Navi Mumbai is the City that is perfect for us, the next question that emerges in our minds is where in Navi Mumbai?
So, to answer this question, I would like to introduce to everyone a beautiful Project named “[Niharika Absolute](https://homecapital.in/project/246/niharika-absolute)” by [Juhi Developers](https://homecapital.in/developer/219/juhi-developers) at Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.

HomeCapital offers [Home down payment assistance](https://homecapital.in/) to bind these apartments with more homebuyers-a service that often allows homebuyers to buy their home early rather than delayed. HomeCapital is an innovator of the Down Payment Assistance (DPA) scheme for homeowners. Under this plan, they provide up to half of the overall amount of down payment, which can be repaid progressively in the next twelve months, and the great thing about it is that you will not be paying interest for the same.
Now, Live a Luxurious and comfortable life with your family at Niharika Absolute.
