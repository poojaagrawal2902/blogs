Smart Homes have become a need of the hour and so the demand for energy-efficient smart homes is steadily rising. One such project is emerging that not only provides contemporary architecture but also features advanced technology - Enter Zenium by Puravankara Limited.

The location of the project is also under a rapid transformation. Purva Zenium is located just off Bellary Road near Bangalore-Hyderabad Highway which also connects to the International Airport Road with a short distance to the Bangalore International Airport.

We discussed about what you can expect when you step out of Zenium, now let’s talk about what you will find inside it.
