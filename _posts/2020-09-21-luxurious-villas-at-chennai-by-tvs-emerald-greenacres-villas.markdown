If you like any of the configurations of the apartment and want to buy it, you can get up to half of the total down payment required through this [home down payment assistance](https://homecapital.in/) program as a zero cost EMI loan. This program is aimed at helping first-time homebuyers purchase their dream home early rather than late, financially. HomeCapital pioneered a no-interest Down Payment Assistance Program (DPA) for home buyers. It is their belief that everyone gets a chance to buy a home for their dream.
