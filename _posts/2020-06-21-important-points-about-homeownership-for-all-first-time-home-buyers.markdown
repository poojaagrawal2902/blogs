[First time home buyers](https://blog.homecapital.in/6-things-all-first-time-home-buyers-should-know-about-homeownership/) may feel like homeownership is a long road. But you can get there in time with some intelligent research, wise planning, and sound savings habits. The emphasis is on ensuring you continue along the path you have chosen.

The trick is to prepare accordingly. While saving is important, it is also very relevant to what you are saving. Saving enough for a home down payment, for example, is wiser than making a smaller down payment. This is because you'll eventually end up paying more interest on a smaller down payment. That is because the value of your home loan will go up, resulting in bigger EMIs. So, try to make sure you've covered all of your bases, and plan strategically in your future.


Since there are so many options out there, a crucial step in your journey to homeownership can be to find the right lender. Choosing the correct lender relies mainly on the interest rate, the lender's tolerance to adjustments in lending rates, approval requirements, and the amount of servicing cost paid on the amount of the loan. So it's necessary to make sure you have a good lender for your goals. It is a professional arrangement that is going to impact how easily you will make your homeownership dream come true.


A credit score will indicate the creditworthiness to lenders. The loan offices calculate that by taking into account variables such as the amount and types of accounts you hold, your used loan and the usable credit, the length of the credit history, and the duration of your credit repayments. It helps lenders to understand how good you were at repaying their debts. Therefore, it's important to maintain a decent credit score. That is what borrowers are going to focus their lending judgment on. Be sure you don't lend by mistake to keep your debts low. Better credit scores also result in lower interest rates on loans.


Although contributing the most to your home down payment is always easier, you don't have to save 20 percent. Many first-time homebuyers believe they should save 20 percent of the home valuation of their house for a down payment. Depending on who the lender is, though, you will get a home loan that is as little as 10 percent down payment. Though spending more home down payment in one go is smarter, don't lose sleep if 20 percent doesn't seem like an amount you should stick to. Using a small home down payment to be able to get your house quicker could also work in your favor. In this situation, rising rents may be something you needn't care about. So, everything is upside-down.


One pervasive fallacy that many prospective first-time homebuyers are working under is that in India there are no home down payment schemes. [HomeCapital](https://homecapital.in/) 's home down payment assistance program can immediately help you buy your first home. The HomeCapital Plan pays interest-free up to 50 percent of the amount of the home down payment. It reduces the waiting period for homeowners to purchase their first home by providing interest-free loans to them, allowing them to lower capital costs. So applying for the down payment assistance plan will help you with the tools to make you become a homeowner faster.


Consideration of closing costs is necessary until you can gain ownership of your house. Closing costs can range from 5 to 10 percent of the home's purchase price. Any of the closure expenses can include taxes on properties, insurance, and other assorted fees. This element is typically overlooked by a large percentage of home buyers when budgeting their savings. Be sure you take these expenses into account so you don't get a scare when you're on the verge of making your homeownership dream come true.
