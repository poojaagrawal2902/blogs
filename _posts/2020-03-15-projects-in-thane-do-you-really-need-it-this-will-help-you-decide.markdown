Every year millions of people move toward the metro cities in search of an income source and to settle. It is also true that these cities have become economical hubs providing multiple jobs to such masses. Adding to it, the government is also investing in facilities that give rise to more commercial demand. There are many organizations making their way into the Indian market in order to invest in their establishment. This is enough to satisfy the working demand of the population, but how to satisfy the housing demand for such a big number of people, a question that still stands tall.


In Mumbai, millions of people commute to work in suburban areas. There is a vast network of transportation that supports the movement of this working population. Even after that, the majority of people think of buying a home that is near to their workplace in order to save the commuting time. People do travel to and from beyond the city limits of Mumbai and its suburbs. Buying a home closer to your workplace is one of the major factors in deciding on buying a home given that financial support is strong. This constant search of the best location is what brings us to Thane, the best location to invest in residential property.


Thane is located next to Mumbai which is also a rapidly growing economic zone. This city not only provides sufficient earning opportunities but also offers space for residential growth. Buying a home in Thane can prove to be the best investment you can ever make. People do prefer to work in Thane because of its close proximity to the neighboring cities which is well connected with great transport infrastructure. 

Thane has a total of 33 lakes which offer serene views. The Eastern Express Highway cuts through the middle of this city and on its banks lie some big shopping malls, renowned healthcare facilities and many more. This city gives its residents enough of everything and due to this, it has come within the view of some of the biggest real estate developers who show interest in making the skyline of this city taller.


Among such real estate giants, one name that stands tall is Shapoorji Pallonji who had made their way by introducing [Northern Lights](https://homecapital.in/property/91/northern-lights-2-bhk) - two towers consisting of luxurious and premium quality 1 and 2 BHK flats. These are supposed to be the tallest towers in Thane. Others include Vijay Groupâ€™s [Orovia Phase 1](https://homecapital.in/property/6/orovia-phase-1-2-bhk) which is another example of the lavish living standard it offers with 1 and 2 BHK accommodations. The list is unending as more and more developers are setting foot on the turf of this real estate playground and Thane is a place that everyone wishes to acquire. Another famous roadway in Thane is the Ghodbunder Road that is a major highway running through the city connecting it to the western parts of Mumbai. Hence, the real estate developers find this place to be a goldmine of residential infrastructure.


Future developments in Thane have been proposed such as a new metro line which will make investing in this city more worthwhile. This city is full of opportunities and growth and buying a home in Thane could be the next best thing.
