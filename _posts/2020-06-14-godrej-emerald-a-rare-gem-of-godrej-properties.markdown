Developers have designed many beautiful residential projects that have brought many homebuyers home and helped them live a happy life. They are now providing a new project named [Godrej Emerald](https://homecapital.in/property/63/godrej-emerald-1-bhk), with the same motivation and for a comfortable lifestyle to get the coolest and best look around. This project is an underbuilt project, with an estimated June 2024 completion date. Godrej Emerald will make a mark on the market and attract all those luxury seekers who believe in life to its fullest potential.

Godrej Emerald, as the name implies, is like a rare gem in the Mumbai cement-concrete jungle. Godrej Emerald is an attractive stop for people wanting to experience life in the middle of nature. It is situated on road to Ghodbunder, Thane. The project is funded by nationally known experts in the area of architecture and construction management. The property itself is planned with open spaces and greenery in mind, considering access to luxury facilities such as a natural environment, a zen garden, a woodland road, and panoramic views of the Yeoor Hills and Vasai Creek.

The project has some benefits for the site as well. The city is based in Thane and offers opportunities for investment and living. The area is connected to NH-3 & NH-4 and is one of the well-developed areas enjoying strong connectivity with the rest of Mumbai. There are a vibrant economic climate and another important aspect of the region. Some of the educational institutions located in the area include Merry Angels International School, D.A.V Public School, and Euro School. Malls like Laker City Mall, Viviana Mall, Korum Mall, and several other malls are popular shopping destinations for themselves. Banks, restaurants, convenience stores, numerous public transports, and the area's good infrastructure make buying an apartment in Godrej Emerald a worthwhile investment. Kapurbawdi Monorail Station lies 15 minutes from the location of the project.
