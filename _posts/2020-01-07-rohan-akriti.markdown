If I ask you which one would you prefer? Spacious Home or a Crammed up place. I think the answer will be common. Everyone would prefer spacious homes with lots of open space. Imagine a home that in absolute terms makes space for you and your loved ones and doesn’t restrict your life but adjusts for the better.

[Rohan Akriti](https://HomeCapital.in/property/73/Rohan-Akriti-1-BHK), a residential project in Bangalore, the above statement becomes true. The unique homes are designed to provide a space for comfortable living without any stretch of an unwanted piece of design that comes in your way. These homes are a blend of the best architectural expertise and art with the efforts to utilize space along with the freedom to move freely. Not only you but natural air moves freely too. The design ensures proper ventilation with openings on opposite sides of the room. You will feel cool breeze moving through the open window through passages and other parts of the room maintaining the freshness of your home always.

Go Green is a moto for all real estate developments nowadays. The developers ensure that the projects use as less energy as possible. The open design allows ample light indoors for a naturally lit room. This way you will save on your electricity bills every time.

Privacy is an important concern for every home buyer. Small apartments usually compromise this fact but at Rohan Akriti you won’t have to settle for such things. The engineers have skillfully designed every room without any common walls so that every member can enjoy their own privacy. Akriti makes smart use of every space so that you don’t have to involve yourself in thinking of how to use an unfunctional corner of your home or throwing a piece of furniture just to fill it up.
