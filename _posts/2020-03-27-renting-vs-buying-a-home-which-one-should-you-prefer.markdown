The long debated topic in real estate is none other than the [comparison between renting and buying a house](https://blog.homecapital.in/rent-vs-buy-here-are-6-factors-to-help-your-evaluate-your-decision/). Everyone has their own set of ideas on either or both matters. Renting a home is mostly preferred by people who have no savings or those who think that renting could help them save money, which, in the long run isn’t really the truth. To determine this, one has to consider various factors such as property price, rental amount, loan details, prospects for appreciation & taxes. For people who can afford to buy a house, the choice between buying and renting is always a tough one.

Why should you rent a house?

In many different cities especially due to high rental rates, students and young professionals often rent a house together. Although this may be economical but sharing a house with a roommate may not be easy. The biggest advantage of sharing an accommodation, is that the individuals can afford to stay in a centrally located area of the city. They share the rent, security deposit and essentials like electricity, water bill, etc. So, the personal expenditure is reduced.

One can even hire a cook, to have home-cooked food. In some cases, such tenants even open a common bank account and one person handles the pay-outs. However, in most cases, each one gives their share on a monthly basis. In case one person is leaving, either all the others pay back his share of the deposit and share the rent amongst themselves, or bring in a new person who takes over from the one exiting. All these are quite well worked out and generally move smoothly. Landlords in cities may also prefer such groups taking up an accommodation, as they stand to get a higher rental, compared to what they would get from a family.


Why should you buy a house?

When you [buy a home](https://homecapital.in/program) you reserve yourself a place to enjoy wonderful moments with your family. Purchasing your first home is one of the most blissful moments. It is where you share those joyous moments with your near and dear ones and get to rest serenely after a long and hectic day while hustling in this fast-paced world.

Buying a home gives you satisfaction and a sense of security along with a pride of ownership. Also, real-estate investment is a safe investment backed by a real asset which has potential of capital appreciation and tax benefits.

There are instances where renting a house is cheaper than buying under certain market conditions. For example cities like Mumbai offer housing options which can be either rented or ,if you have sufficient funds, bought. If you are certain about the city in which you are going to stay in the future and have the necessary funds for the down payment and stable future cash flows, it is highly recommended to own a home. Owning a home forces savings, in the form of home loan EMI payments, which most people would otherwise spend, if they rent a property.

Benefits of renting a home: Depending on your financial situation and preferred style of living, there are many advantages to renting.

1) Renting a home can be cheaper than buying a home. Your payments tend to be lower than a comparable house payment. Also, your rent may cover utility costs (additional savings).

2) You have more flexibility when you rent. Most leases are for 12 months. So, if your job requires you to move frequently, renting can be a desirable alternative to buying.

3) Your landlord, not you, is responsible for performing nearly all maintenance and repair work on the property.

Benefits of buying a home: 1) Greater privacy. 2) Homes typically increase in value, build equity and provide a nest egg for the future. 3) Your costs are predictable and more stable than renting because they’re ideally based on a fixed-rate mortgage. 4) The interest and property tax portion of your mortgage payment is a tax deduction. 5) There’s pride in homeownership, which also closely ties you to your community.

There are multiple benefits of buying a house over renting a house, the major one being that buying a house is cheaper than renting one in the long run. To make the decision easier, now there is a home down payment assistance program that helps first time home buyers with their down payment needs. The program has been pioneered by the HomeCapital platform.

The platform fulfills the home down payment needs of the first time buyers with its interest free home down payment assistance program. The program can contribute up to half of the home down payment required which can be then repaid over a period of time in easy interest free installments. HomeCapital platform includes both premium and affordable projects with various configurations under their program for various budgets. The objective is to encourage the buyers to fulfill their home buying dream now rather than waiting for accumulation of savings.

Buying a home early has compounding wealth benefits, happier lives and social security for your family.
