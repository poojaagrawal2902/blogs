What is the most beautiful thing that you dreamed about? Maybe, travelling to another country or buying a home of your dreams or living a peaceful future with your family or the best of all- everything at once. What if this could be made possible? What if the dreams that you see every day becomes true? Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it is possible to live such a life.

We are talking about[ Puraniks Rumah Bali,](https://homecapital.in/property/19/puraniks---rumah-bali-1-bhk) a project that is designed with an international concept of the Indonesian city Bali. The idea is inspired by the Balinese Lifestyle which evokes the thought of being in a paradise. It is not just a place but an aspiration to live the easy going Balinese Lifestyle without leaving the country. The project is located at the edge of Ghodbunder Road, Thane West. This prime location is one of the most desired in the minds of the real estate developers. This road runs through the heart of Thane connecting both Eastern and Western Express Highways together making it the most suitable transport infrastructure.

We have covered the location aspect of Rumah Bali, so now let’s move on to the specifications of this beautiful project. This residential architecture consists of high rise towers with multi-family apartments spread across 10 acres of land. The aspect of Balinese design was made possible by the Singaporean Designers at Taib Studios. Every effort was made in order to recreate the quintessential essence of Bali within Thane. The project is designed to bring the feeling of a calm and soothing environment at your home. Not only the apartments but the surrounding is also made to give out a Balinese vibe to the residents of Rumah Bali. One of the best attractions include - a courtyard full of Plumeria flower giving out a nirvana manipulating your mind to spend some lazy hours under its shade.

Talking about Nature, there’s so much more to see and feel in Rumah Bali. According to the Balinese Lifestyle, being closer to nature is vital and this statement had been there in the minds of Puranik Builders while developing this residential configuration. The inspiration has been drawn from the Bali culture while designing the offerings to rejuvenate the mind while you take a stroll. The clubhouse is designed with water bodies surrounding its premises. Although they are made to look like natural water bodies you can still take a quick swim to relax the tension in your muscles and mind.

The Puranik Group comes along with a good track record making them one of the most respected real estate developers having presence in Thane, Lonavala, Pune and Neral.

There are many other amenities that one could take benefit of. The basic necessities are within a close range from the project. Educational facilities are present and accounted for within 3.5 km radius. Similarly, healthcare services and corporate locations are within a reach of 1.5 km from Rumah Bali.
