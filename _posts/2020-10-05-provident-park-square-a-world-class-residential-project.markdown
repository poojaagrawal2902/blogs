Provident Park Square is a recently launched residential project by Provident Housing in Bengaluru. This project is strategically located in the Judicial Layout on Kanakapura Road. This project is a perfect example of the term premium on a budget. It is spread across 20 acres of land surrounded by greenery and beautiful environment. This project is unique on its own with an elegant and sophisticated touch and as a result you will enjoy every moment you spend here. The space is filled with a calm atmosphere that is your own to witness. This residential project promises a luxury and yet a simple lifestyle for you to follow with all the prime amenities closer to you. The idea behind this is to make your life more comfortable and easy and offer all the facilities within an armâ€™s reach.

Kanakapura road is one of the major roads connecting Bangalore to the town of Kanakapura spanning 55 kms to the south of Bangalore. This area is very well known for its rapid infrastructural development and its proximity to the NICE ring road which is merely 5 kms away. The international airport is only 45 kms away. This area is far away from the daily noise of a metropolis and offers a quiet and peaceful environment and as a result this location is one of the most sought after choices among the home buyers. The connectivity to this area will be further enhanced with the introduction of the Namma Metro Phase 2 extending 6.2 kms from Konankunte to Majestic having a station here at Kanakapura. One more reason for this location to be one of the best for buying a home is that it has all the necessary social amenities nearby. You can find many civic amenities nearby which includes renowned hospitals like Vasan Eye Care, Apollo, Fortis, and Sri Sai Ram, Delhi Public School, K S School of Engineering and Management, Ritu Hospital, City Engineering College, Malls and other health care centres are within a radius of 10 kms. The upcoming Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) will connect Kanakapura Road to Tumkur Road, Old Madras Road, and Hosur Road. Thus all these factors contribute to the growth of real estate in this area.
