This project is an underbuilt project, with an expected June 2024 completion date.

Godrej Emerald, as the name implies, is like a precious diamond in the Mumbai cement-concrete area. Godrej Emerald is an attractive stop for people wanting to experience life in the middle of nature.

The property itself is planned with open spaces and greenery in mind, considering access to luxury facilities such as a natural environment, a zen garden, a woodland road, and panoramic views of the Yeoor Hills and Vasai Creek.

Malls such as Laker City Mall, Viviana Mall, Korum Mall, and a host of other malls are themselves popular shopping destinations. Banks, restaurants, convenience stores, numerous public transports, and the area's good infrastructure make buying an apartment in Godrej Emerald a worthwhile investment. Kapurbawdi Monorail Station lies 15 minutes from the location of the project.
