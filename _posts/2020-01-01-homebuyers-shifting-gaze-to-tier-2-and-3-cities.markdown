It was in the 90sâ€™ when people use to buy their own house with all their savings close to their retirement rather than taking a home loan. It was also due to the fact that banks were disinclined towards lending such a huge amount of money, which is now completely changed.

Since the 2000s, the home loans became imminent and the target population was the young buyers specifically aged between 30-45. It was now possible to buy a home even with little savings. This is not the case nowadays. As finance is now simplified, the next challenge in front of the buyers is to find a house at the desired location. 

The population migrates from the rural areas to the urban and semi-urban cities in search of work opportunities. This has made the major metro cities to almost reaching their limit of providing living space to everyone. Now real estate is no longer limited to the major cities and so the buyers are shifting their interests to the tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Among the top choices were Pune, Nashik, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Indore, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad. The initiatives undertaken by the government such as Smart Cities, Housing for All, and AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) are also fueling the desires for [purchasing an apartment](http://blog.homecapital.in/5-advantages-of-purchasing-an-apartment-in-a-tier-2-city/) of the new home buyers.

Apart from the government initiatives, the other factors that add up to the real estate expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities are lower property rates, lower living expenses, infrastructural growth, growth in job opportunities and a good pay scale. The real estate investment has seen a rise because these cities possess a growth potential that can even rival the major metropolises. The increasing industrial growth and a good job market witnessed in tier 2 and 3 cities have attracted buyers and real estate developers to expand the residential segment. These cities are well connected to the metro cities with improved transport infrastructure with major highways, railways and even airways.

The sentiment values also play a vital role in investing in low tier cities. The population employed in the service sector ends up living away from their families in order to earn their living in the major metro cities. However, with the change in residential real estate growth and the possibility of investing in a home, earning members can live closely or even with their families.

The future for tier 2 and tier 3 cities are expected to be brighter due to the rise in the infrastructural development with the Smart Cities initiative by the government. This is already in action running in its first phase and the government is ready to pump more capital in it. It is possible to see an enormous shift of population towards tier 2 and tier 3 cities in the future. The demand for residential as well as commercial spaces is expected to rise in the 100 smart cities after they are developed.
