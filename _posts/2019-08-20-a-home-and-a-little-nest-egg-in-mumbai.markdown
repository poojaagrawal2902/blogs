Buying a home in Mumbai is certainly fraught with challenges, personal & financial both. I know so because I have been through the entire process. I always wished to not only have a luxurious home but one which is also surrounded by nature. So, I started my home search with looking for a locality that could offer me both. After a lot of research, I decided upon Thane as I felt it could offer me the best of both worlds.

With an abundance of greenery and clean air, with 33 lakes and more than 50 gardens, the place has been attracting buyers who seek an enriching lifestyle. Also, the Thane real estate market is very much in demand & developing at a fast rate. The area has many residential properties that offer affordable, luxurious and ultra-luxurious housing options & are being constructed by known and trustworthy developers who offer ample choices to their customers along with a wide array of amenities.

Thus, having decided to settle down in Thane, I started looking for property developers online that offered homes in my buying range. During my research, I came across Puraniks Builders. I had already heard a lot about Puraniks Builders reputation & projects through word-of-mouth. Puraniks are one of the cityâ€™s well known and most reputed real estate developers operating in Thane, Pune and Nashik cities. The developers are known for high standards, excellent quality of building, timely property possession and affordable pricing. So, when I came to know about the Puraniks Grand Central project located at Vartak Nagar in Thane, I was very excited to know about the project.  Vartak Nagar is one of the most premium areas in Thane and has many malls, schools and hospitals. It is located very near to the Thane railway station and major transit routes and proposed corporate campuses. Puranik [Grand Central ](https://homecapital.in/property/27/puraniks---grand-central-2-bhk)has sumptuous urban facilities and excellent ambience, making it one of the most sought after destinations by home buyers in Thane as well as Mumbai. Puraniks strategic central location allows for great connectivity and easy accessibility from every part of Thane and Mumbai. 

To add to this, the cherry on top for a first time home buyer like me was when, during research, I came to know that the Puraniks Group has tied-up with the HomeCapital guys who have pioneered the home [down payment](https://homecapital.in/program) assistance program in India. Believe me, it was of great help to me financially. Through this program, due to a stable job & good credit history, I applied for and received around 50% of the total down payment amount required to book my Grand Central 2 BHK apartment as zero cost EMI loan. The payment plan for the same was a CLP, so, a total win-win for me. I got to save a little nest egg for the future, too, through this Program instead of having to shell out all my savings on the down payment amount. They also ensured that my home buying journey was hassle free till the end. I am still thankful for their services and would recommend them to everyone who is looking to buy a home. Hence, I can say my dream of having a home surrounded by luxury and greenery was fulfilled.
