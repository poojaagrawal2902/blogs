As soon as I completed my graduation in Law, I landed myself into a job as a lawyer in Mumbai. I completed three years in the law firm setting my career and to save enough to complete my next motto which was to buy a house. So, my goal to choose a place of living was not only to be surrounded by city life but also close to nature. Hence, I started my research on buying a new home and selecting a place according to my comfort. I started researching on the internet looking for various places in Mumbai which would satisfy my requirements. After speaking to a lot of people and travelling to various places, I became enamoured with Thane. This megapolis is well planned with modern infrastructure to absorb the demand to provide a convenient and holistic lifestyle to its residents. Thane’s transition from being Mumbai’s village cousin to a legitimate vibrant city has been a rapid, if not a very smooth one.

So, immediately after the place was finalized, I studied the market looking for properties online. My research for the perfect home came to an end when I found The Puraniks Group. I did a little bit of digging on them and found their projects to be very unique when compared to others. The developers have completed about 35 projects and are known for their high standards, excellent quality of work, timely possession and affordable pricing.

The [Puraniks Tokyo Bay](https://homecapital.in/property/23/puraniks---tokyo-bay-1-bhk), a Japanese themed residential project caught my interest. The developer has put the best efforts to bring the elements of Japanese architecture and landscapes into this structure. The concept of planning revolves around the ‘Zen’ lifestyle. This landmark majestically stands just off the Ghodbunder Road, Thane West. Nestled far from the chaos of the main city and set in a green pocket, this residence is a convenient address due to its proximity to the Ghodbunder Road. Could this setting have been more idealistic? A strategic placement I would say. This major roadway infrastructure connects important destinations like the Western and Eastern Express Highways. What’s more, this highway brings the satellite city of Navi Mumbai closer too. This arterial road has turned the location into a bustling destination with some of the best shopping, entertainment and restaurant chains popping up at every junction along with educational facilities, healthcare specialities and corporate hubs. The project is being developed on a 25-acre land parcel offering spacious 1 BHK apartments. I was really satisfied with Puranik Developers for them providing with such an innovative concept for the people.

The financial aspect of buying my home was a breeze too. My savings were enough for the down payment, however, I was a bit skeptical about spending all my hard earned money at once. I found something known as Home Down Payment Assistance Program online which helped me save up to half of my savings along with help me achieving my dream of buying a home of my dreams.
