The [Vaishnavi Group](https://homecapital.in/offering/developer/vaishnavi-group) is excited to design signature designer homes that align with the lifestyle needs of urban Indians. The projects of the Vaishnavi Group are designed using the best of class construction technologies and idea analysis.

Spread over a sprawling 10-acre 33 guntas, Vaishnavi Serene is a home like no other in Bengaluru.
