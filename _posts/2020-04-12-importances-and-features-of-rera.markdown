[RERA](https://blog.homecapital.in/rera/) stands for Real Estate Regulation Act is a buyer-friendly initiative initiated by India's government from 1 May 2017. The government's action is a hot topic for discussion and its impact on the real estate market.

As committed to a buyer-friendly act, RERA has some specific features:
Under RERA, each state will have to set up regulatory bodies as appeals tribunals to settle the purchaser-developer disputes within 120 days.
To cover the project's building costs, the contractor would have to put 70 percent of the money received from a buyer into a separate account.
RERA also aims to enforce stringent controls on the promoter and to ensure completion of construction on time.
The buyer can only pay for the area of the carpet (area within walls). As is currently the norm, the developer can not charge for the superbly built-up area.
Developers will only be able to sell projects after getting the necessary clearances. Under RERA, developers and agents will be expected to register with the regulator and have all projects registered with more than eight apartments before launch.

Unless they do not comply with the RERA rules and regulations, the developers will face adverse consequences. They may lose project registration. They could also face imprisonment for up to a maximum period of three years and/or could be fined up to a maximum of 10 percent of the total estimated cost of the project. If a developer defaults or delays in granting buyers ownership of the property as stated in the 'sale agreement,' buyers may withdraw from the project and claim a full refund of the amount paid along with a certain interest rate. The buyers have the full right to take advantage of the refund even if the card is canceled.

If the buyers are not happy with the decision passed by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority or the Adjudicating Officer, they may appeal the same to the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (REAT). REAT provides home buyers with many advantages. Homebuyers, for example, only need to pay for the carpet area. Developers also need to notify buyers of any minor changes in the project, and developers need to obtain approval from at least 2/3 of buyers in case of any significant amendments.

Thus, in a nutshell, RERA is a boon for [home buyers](https://homecapital.in/program).
