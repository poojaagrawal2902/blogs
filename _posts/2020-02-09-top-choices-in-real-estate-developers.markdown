The real estate industry is a vast playground where many players compete for the position of being the best in the country. To ensure that they are in the game for long, the developers put their efforts into trying to attract and hold on to more buyers under their umbrella of options, thus, buyers will have a load of options that fits in their budget and needs. There are many real estate builders across India competing against each other, but the question stands as to who is the best among them? According to a report by Track2Realty, among the top 10 best real estate developers, the best five comes from Mumbai followed by three from Bengaluru and two from NCR. Mumbai stands as the best location for a real estate investment.

The best preferred national brands as per the NRI & HNI buyers are Shobha Limited, **[Godrej Properties](https://HomeCapital.in/offering/developer/godrej-properties)**, Prestige Group, Embassy Group, Ashiana Housing, K Raheja Corp, DLF, Sunteck Realty, Oberoi Realty, and Piramal Realty. The Indian Real Estate Market is very unstable as per the NRIs and HNIs with their reasons not to invest in India but abroad and with the uncertainty in the financial sector, it has further reinforced their thoughts. Increasing taxation, high prices, improper returns, and unstable policies further add fuel to the fire.

This was from the perspective of rich buyers, but what about the affordable home buyers that contributes to the majority of the population? After all, many government initiatives and policies are targeting this group. Under the Housing for All 2022 mission, the government is planning to provide up to 20 million affordable homes by March 2022. With such efforts, it has now become possible for **[purchasing an apartment](https://blog.homecapital.in/5-advantages-of-purchasing-an-apartment-in-a-tier-2-city/)** in a tier 2 city with almost the same facilities of a property in a tier 1 city, but at a lower price. Many real estate developers are now focusing on providing affordable homes to buyers with certain rules and regulations concerned with protecting the rights of the home buyers.

So as per the preference, the real estate developers dominating the top choices are Godrej Properties, ATS, Mahagun, ABA Corp, Central Park, Sobha Limited, Gulshan Homz and Mahindra Lifespaces in North India.

Sobha Limited, followed by Prestige Group, Embassy Group, Brigade Group, Godrej Properties, **[Puravankara Limited](https://homecapital.in/offering/developer/puravankara-limited)**, Akshaya Homes, Total Environment, Mahindra Lifespaces and Salarpuria Sattva hold their places in South India.

K Raheja Corp, Godrej Properties, Sunteck Realty, Oberoi Realty, Piramal Realty, Hiranandani Group, Kalpataru, Adani Realty, Mahindra Lifespaces, and Shapoorji Pallonji dominate West India.

The top 10 choices in East India are Ambuja Neotia, South City Projects, Forum Group, Siddha Group, RDB Realty, Srijan Realty, PS Group, Unimark, Shrachi Realty, and Mani Group.
