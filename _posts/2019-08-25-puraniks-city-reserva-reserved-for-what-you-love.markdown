My sister is a dentist while I am a software developer in Mumbai. I and my sister had been living in Mumbai on rent for a year now.  So putting our savings together we decided to buy a house. Our goal was to find a place with a lot of greenery, we didn't want a place which was too crowded. So based on our goal we started hunting for our dream home. After doing a lot of research, visiting various places and making contacts with friends, we concluded that Thane was a good place for our new home, as it not only provides relief from the congestion of Mumbai, but it also offers residential properties which are both affordable and spacious.

Thane is aptly called the 'city of lakes' and with the well-planned cities infrastructure, there are many gardens and green spaces dotting the city. Over the years, Thane has developed from a small town to a well-built megapolis. Widened highways, well-maintained flyovers, and other infrastructural developments are making Thane, one reliable choice over others. City’s infrastructure is something that makes a deal. And in the case of Thane, it proves a good deal for a lifetime.

So after deciding that Thane would be a decent place for our dream home, our next step was searching for the right property developer. So after searching on the internet and going through different residential projects, we came across Puranik Developers. The developers had completed about 35 projects and are known for their high standards, excellent quality of construction, timely possession and affordable pricing. Their projects were very unique and they were not only surrounded by luxury but also natural beauty. So we researched some of their projects and found our interest in [Puranik City Reserva](https://homecapital.in/property/24/puraniks---city-reserva-1-bhk). Situated at Ghodbunder Road, Thane West, Puranik City Reserva is surrounded with greenery and unheard features like unshared walls and front garden and many premium amenities for family members. Whether it’s a Barbeque corner for a special meal together or a jogging track to burn calories after a heavy intake. Whether it’s an Amphitheatre for entertainment or the elderly nook for contentment. Whether it’s a multi-purpose lawn or the bamboo court. It has everything necessary for everyone's comfort. So, satisfied with all their offers we selected on Puranik Developers.

It was still a long way before we could call it our home. The biggest hurdle that was standing in front of us was the financial aspect of buying the home, to be precise - the down payment. Even with our savings totalled as one was sufficient for the down payment, we were still in a stage of consideration of us to let go of such a huge amount at once. We had already decided on our new home and to let it go because of money, was the last thing that we would think of.

We both decided to go forward with the plan of buying this property whatever it takes. So after a few more days of hardcore thinking and research, we finally came across a financial aid that was helping the first time buyers to buy their dream home. The Home Down Payment Assistance Program was the best product we could have ever found. It helped us to save up to half of our down payment and made our dream of owning a house reality.
