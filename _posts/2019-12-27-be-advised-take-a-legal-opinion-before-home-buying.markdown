Ensure that you verify if the builder has complied with the laws and procedures related to the construction of the property.

IOD, Completion & Occupancy Certificates: IOD or Intimation of Disapproval means that the builder has obtained all the required NOCs which is finalized by providing the Commencement Certificate. Completion & Occupancy certificates are also issued by the local municipal body stating that the property satisfies the building standards as per the originally approved plan and has all the necessary clearances such as electricity, water, fire safety, and sewage.

There are various other legal certificates and documents that need to be finalized prior to the possession of the property such as Encumbrance Certificate, Sale Deed, Allotment Letter, Possession Certificate, Tripartite Agreement, Maintenance Service Agreements (MSA), No Dues Certificate, Joint Development Agreement, and others. At last, there are multiple tax benefits under section 24, 80C, 80E, and 80EE.

Finally, there are few things that you as a buyer must check before taking the keys to your new home. Ensure that the final setup of your property is the same as it is mentioned in the brochure/agreement. Measure the dimensions of the living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, balcony to make certain that you are being delivered what was promised. Verify that all the safety measures are in place. Check the walls, flooring, paint for any cracks or major defects. Look for safe electrical connections and ensure that the provided equipment such as lights, sockets, plugs, buttons are working properly. Make sure that there’s no broken wiring anywhere around the house. Check if you have proper water supply at the required places.

You can also hire a home inspection service that will do all the work for a nominal fee. At last, obtain all the set of keys to your home to be on the safer side. You can consult with professionals for more refined guidance. Taking a legal opinion before every step is advised.

Good Luck!
