Ever wondered what it feels like to be a part of nature while still being close to the modern world? A world that you haven’t experienced yet. A world that looks just like you would see inside dream folklore. No, this is not a story or a film. I’m talking about an upcoming residential project by Puravankara Limited - Purva Smiling Willows.

Smiling Willows is an under-construction residential project located off Bannerghatta Road, Bengaluru. This is not just any residential project, it is a series of super luxurious villas and condos enclosed within a 20-acres lush green zone. This project maintains the tranquility of nature without compromising the modern world’s touch. Purva Smiling Willows is based on the theme of a beautiful rainforest. A picturesque scene that is suitable for a fairy tale. Even though the location of the project is in the heart of the city, you are still far away from the hustling that you experience in a metropolis. What can you expect when you enter through the main gate? Let’s Explore…

As you step inside the premise you are welcomed by a series of condos on both sides. Just as you walk past you can see the main internal pathway that runs between the villas across the premises giving you easy access to every possible attraction & amenities present within. The project is bordered by a green wall that is not only beautiful but also acts as a barrier between you and the outside world. Apart from that, there are many other places that you can visit within the project. Witness the beauty of the biggest manmade waterfall that adds to the already alluring natural scenery. It is a true example of perfect architecture combined with creative artistry. Start your day by looking at the majestic view of this waterfall and experience every bit of calmness you feel.

Speaking of calmness and peace here’s something that perfectly defines it. Enter the Mind and Body Temple. Who could be a better example of peace than Buddha himself? As you enter you are welcomed by a grand imposing Buddha statue. Just take some time out from your daily schedule and visit the temple to relax and purify your mind, body, and soul. The setting of this place is designed specifically to calm your senses and make you start noticing things that usually go unnoticed. The No Footwear Zone is a place that is created to uplift your mood while you take a stroll over different pathways filled with pebbles, water, river sand, and grass. This surely will be one of your most elegant experiences inside Smiling Willows. There are numerous other amenities that focus on health and recreation available within the premise.

Puravankara Limited has strategically planned the location of the project. It is located off Bannerghatta Road connecting with NICE Road, a major road connecting Bangalore and Mysore. You have all the daily necessities close to the project. The major areas of JP Nagar, BTM Layout and Jayanagar are in close proximity. There are major schools nearby such as Poddar International School, Ryan International School, St.Mary School and more. Healthcare facilities include Fortis, Apollo, Jayadeva Hospitals. Shopping and entertainment are also nearby such as Spar Vega City Mall, Hypercity, Metro Mall and many others. Tech Parks such as IBM, Convergys, Electronic City, etc are also close by.

At Smiling Willows you can enjoy being close to nature while also being at the heart of the city sheltered with lush green forest. Catch up with your lost time, relive your life and enjoy the peace at Purva Smiling Willows by Puravankara Limited.
