[Buying your first home](https://blog.HomeCapital.in/simplify-your-approach-to-buying-your-first-home/) is a huge financial decision and one mishap can bring your solid future financial planning crumbling down.

**EMI Calculation:** The EMI or Equated Monthly Instalment is the amount that the borrower pays the lender for a certain period of time for the repayment of the loan. This includes the amount towards the repayment plus the interest charged by the lender. The type of interest charged can be categorized either as Fixed-Rate or Floating Rate. Fixed means the ROI or Rate of Interest is fixed for the entire tenure of the repayment whereas Floating rates are dynamic and changes as per the market conditions, however, they are much cheaper than Fixed rates.

Planning your EMIs: It is very much important to plan your budget for buying your home first. It will help you to estimate how much home loan you can afford and look for a property accordingly. The lenders allow up to 70% of your income as EMI as a general rule of thumb. Be careful, just because it is possible doesn’t mean you have to go with it. An EMI of up to 40-50% of your income should be an ideal choice. After all, you also have to have sufficient funds for other necessary and critical expenses.

Early planning of home loans can help you save money on the home down payment which is usually 20% of the property price. You can utilize your time to explore the options of different lenders, the rate of interest offered and choose the best accordingly. It is crucial to have solid financial planning beforehand, however, repayment of the loan on time holds equal importance. So how can you repay your home loan with the least obstacles?
\

\
Prepayment: If you have something extra apart from your projected funds, it is advisable to put it towards repaying the home loan early. Employees do get bonuses and incentives over the regular salary so why not put it to the right use. Keep some of it for the prepayment of your home loan. Consider the prepayment charges if any and consult with your lender for the same.
\

\
Repayment Tenure: What is the best home loan tenure? This question always arises. The answer is that you should choose the maximum permissible tenure that is offered by the lender. Do not assume that you can handle your EMIs easily. It is about being prepared for times of income shortage due to any unforeseen events so you do not miss your EMI.
\

\
Switching to a different lender: Of course, you can choose another lender for the repayment who offers a low rate of interest than the current one. While you are taking this step make sure that you consider the cost of switching and adjust it with the benefits of lower rates.

Invest in your home early: Everything will depend on how well you start your home buying journey. It is very important that one should plan a financial investment early to generate enough funds for the down payment. The more down payment you pay the less will be the home loan and shorter will be the tenure. It will help protect the buyer from financial crises during the repayment of the home loan.
