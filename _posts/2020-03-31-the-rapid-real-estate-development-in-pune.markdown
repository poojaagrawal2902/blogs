Pune is known as the Oxford of the East and is considered among one of the best cities to live in. It is the second biggest city in Maharashtra after the state’s capital, Mumbai. Pune is one of the fastest growing urban communities in the Asia-Pacific region. Also known as the social capital of Maharashtra, this city attracts many home buyers for them to fulfill their goal of a dream home.

Year by year, Pune has shown a consistent growth in terms of urbanization.

Despite the general slowdown witnessed across other major cities, Pune realty market stood firm mainly due to high demand from the IT sector. Adding to it when we compare Pune to other metro cities, the property prices are reasonably affordable.

Being an IT and training center, worldwide and nearby engineers have been seen to be rushing the city with fresh development wagering on future development as more IT and other corporations set up their shops here.

If there’s something that proves the real development of real estate in a city, it is the development of the rural areas around it.

The blast of IT organizations, manufacturing industries of vast, medium and even small scale, cosmopolitan city culture, rapidly developing infrastructure, the abundance of educational institutions are the major contributors to Pune's economy.

This airport will lift up some pressure from the Lohegaon Airport which is currently handling both domestic and international traffic right now. This airport is located at Purandar which is around 45 kms away from Pune. The property markets in Pune will have a better chance of witnessing growth after this development.
