[Godrej Properties](https://homecapital.in/offering/developer/godrej-properties) has developed several real-estate development projects in India. Many magnificent housing projects were designed by developers that took home many homebuyers and made them lead a happier life. They are now offering a new project called [Godrej Emerald](https://homecapital.in/property/63/godrej-emerald-1.5-bhk), to get the coolest and best feeling around with the same idea and for a relaxed lifestyle. This project, with an estimated completion date of June 2024, is underbuilt. Godrej Emerald will make a mark on the market and attract to its fullest extent all those luxury seekers who believe in life.

Godrej Emerald, as the name implies, is like a precious diamond project for Godrej Properties. Godrej Emerald is an enticing stop in the middle of nature for people seeking to experience life. It is located in Thane, on the road to Ghodbunder. The project is funded in the area of architecture and construction management by internationally recognized consultants. Taking into account access to luxurious amenities such as a natural forest, a zen garden, a woodland path, and panoramic views of the Yeoor Hills and Vasai Creek, the property itself is designed with open spaces and greenery in mind.

The project also has some advantages for the area. The town is located in Thane and provides investment and living opportunities. The region is connected to NH-3 & NH-4 and is one of the well-developed areas with good connectivity to the rest of Mumbai. There are a flourishing economic climate and another critical dimension to the region. Merry Angels International School, D.A.V Public School, and Euro School are among some of the educational institutions in this region. The famous shopping destinations themselves are malls such as Laker City Mall, Viviana Mall, Korum Mall, and a host of other malls. Banks, restaurants, convenience stores, various public transport services, and the area's strong infrastructure make it a worthwhile investment to buy an apartment in Godrej Emerald. Kapurbawdi Monorail Station is situated 15 minutes from the project's location.

One of the most critical factors for choosing to purchase a home is luxury facilities. To promote world-class living standards, Godrej has maintained world-class facilities at Godrej Emerald, some of which are: Indoor Badminton Hall cum Multi-purpose hall, Squash Court, Library, Poolside Cafe, Mini Theatre, Table Tennis, Fitness Center, Steam Room, Creche area, Amphitheatre, Semi Covered- Swimming Pool, Multi-purpose play court, Box-Cricket, Stage cum Skating rink, CaCanopy walk, Kidsâ€™ play area (for every wing), Semi covered sitting pavilions (for every building), Open-air seating areas, Business center, Party lawn, Wi-fi zone in the clubhouse, Jogging Track, Viewing Gallery, Rock climbing wall, Open gym, Treehouse, Meditation pavilion, Nature walk/ trail, Sandpit, Acupressure walkway, Outdoor dining area, Concierge desk, Martial arts area, Putting green, Birdhouse, Yoga corner/ reiki, Aerobics/ Zumba studio, Pet corner, Well-designed entrance lobbies, Hammock zone.
