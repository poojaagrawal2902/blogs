After delivering 35 projects in the city, they are now coming up with the new landmark, called [Puraniks Rumah Bali](https://homecapital.in/property/19/puraniks---rumah-bali-1-bhk). The developers planned to produce a new project with excellent building quality, affordable rates, and timely ownership, as the demands for real estate are growing. Currently, under construction, this project is expected to be completed by December 2022.

This project is a 10-acre multi-residential complex comprising 7 towers designed by the prestigious Singaporean Architecture House-Taib Studio. 1 BHK and 2 BHK are the apartment sizes. The main aim of the developers is to recreate the charm of Bali in Thane by using the design of Balinese architecture, with a large stunning landscape featuring water bodies and cabanas, and a courtyard full of Plumeria flowers from Bali. The property is located on Thane (west) Ghodbunder Lane, Bhayander Pada. The accessibility of the project makes it directly accessible to the western and central areas of the city. The house is an affordable size, and it is valued by prospective homebuyers. There are also luxury facilities that provide a comfortable lifestyle for homebuyers.

The highlight of the project is the location. Thane is among the most prominent residential neighborhoods in Mumbai. The two main arterial nodes of Mumbai are within 20 km of this building, the Eastern Expressway Highway & Western Expressway Highway. Thane Railway Station is 16 km away and is easily accessible through good public transport connections. For families searching for a comfortable life, many top-rated schools & colleges have made this place a dream home. The location of the house is 1 km from Vijay Garden, the Big Shopping Centre, and Kevalya Hospital.

The amenities offered in this residential area allow the home buyer to have a more comfortable and convenient life.

For the safety of the residential area, there is 24x7 monitoring and fire fighting equipment.

The best part of this project is creation and architecture, which shows the culture of Balinese design philosophy with charming landscapes that boast water bodies. The Rumah Bali Puraniks is becoming more popular and is one of the most trusted residential projects in Thane West. It is now considered a well-known Puranik Culture project due to its special existence.

The popular landmarks are Hypercity Mall, Vedant Hospital, D-Mart, Euro Kindergarten, G-Corp, and the project has all the basic needs within its reach.
